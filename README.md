C Array Split Demonstrator
​This project contains a minimal C program designed to demonstrate fundamental array operations, including initialization, size calculation, and the process of splitting a larger array into two smaller, fixed-size child arrays.
​Features
​Array Initialization: Defines a parent array (array) with ten integer elements.
​Size Calculation: Dynamically determines the size of the parent array at runtime using sizeof.
​Splitting Logic: Splits the parent array evenly into two distinct child arrays (arr1 and arr2).
​Output: Prints the size and contents of the parent array, followed by the contents of both child arrays.
​Code Overview
​The program performs the following steps:
​Initializes an integer array array of size 10.
​Calculates and prints the size of the array.
​Copies the first half of array (elements 0 through 4) into arr1.
​Copies the second half of array (elements 5 through 9) into arr2.
​Prints the contents of all three arrays.
